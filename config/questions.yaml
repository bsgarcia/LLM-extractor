questions:
  - "Comment on how the attribution to groups was implemented  (randomization type). Also was it 
  random, pseudo-random (when matched for age/gender baseline, etc...) or cluster-random (e.g. by classroom)?"
  - "Find the sample size WITHOUT the drop outs (i.e. the final N used in the analysis).
  Same thing but depending on groups. What was the number of participants (included in analysis) in the training groups? And in control groups (if any)?"
  - "Find the inclusion criteria."
  - "Find the exclusion criteria."
  - "What was the training duration? Compute step by step. calculate as follow: e.g. 10-15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks ->
   =((10*5*2) + (15*5*2)) /2; take the mean between the minimum and maximum"
  - "What was the CONTROL duration? Compute step by step. calculate as follow: e.g. 10-15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks ->
   =((10*5*2) + (15*5*2)) /2; take the mean between the minimum and maximum"
  - "describe the activity of the control group. BAU = business as usual = what participants would normally do during that time"
  - "Were the assessors blind?"
  - "Are there primary and secondary outcomes? If yes, what are they? Near transfer? Far transfer?"
  - "What is the socioeconomic status of the participants? Is there interindividual variability?"
  - "Do participants have any diagnosis (e.g. ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, depression, etc...)? If ADHD, specify the subtype (inattentive, hyperactive, combined). Also specify if medicated or not."
  - "For each task (focus on these dimensions: inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention. For other kind of tasks (e.g. intelligence with WAIS), make a 'others' section), specify the task name (e.g. Stroop, Flanker, N-back) and mean and sd of the main performance measure at pre AND post training. 
  Do this for the training groups but ALSO for the control group."
