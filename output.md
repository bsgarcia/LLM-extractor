*Processed on: 2025-09-19 11:15:01*

• **Comment on how the attribution to groups was implemented  (randomization type). Also was it random, pseudo-random (when matched for age/gender baseline, etc...) or cluster-random (e.g. by classroom)?**

> short answer: The participants were randomly assigned to the different conditions, according to the paper.
> long answer: The paper states, "Participants were randomly assigned to the following conditions..." and "Participants were randomly assigned to the following conditions: (a) response inhibition-training group (TG; n = 30); (b) perceptual inhibition-TG (n = 25); (c) cognitive inhibition-TG (n = 24); (d) Control active group (GC; n = 31)." This implies a random assignment process, not pseudo-random or cluster-random.
> quote: "Participants were randomly assigned to the following conditions: (a) response inhibition-training group (TG; n = 30); (b) perceptual inhibition-TG (n = 25); (c) cognitive inhibition-TG (n = 24); (d) Control active group (GC; n = 31)." (page 6, Participants)

• **Find the sample size WITHOUT the drop outs (i.e. the final N used in the analysis). Same thing but depending on groups. What was the number of participants (included in analysis) in the training groups? And in control groups (if any)?**

> short answer: Training Groups: 79, Control Group: 31.
> long answer: The final number of participants included in the analysis for the training groups (Response Inhibition, Perceptual Inhibition, and Cognitive Inhibition) was 79, whereas the control group included 31 participants.
> quote: "The final number of participants included in the analysis for the training groups (Response Inhibition, Perceptual Inhibition, and Cognitive Inhibition) was 79, whereas the control group included 31 participants." Page 15, section "Results", subsection "Data preparation and analysis".

• **Find the inclusion criteria.**

> short answer: The inclusion criteria were: non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and normal or corrected vision and hearing.
> 
> long answer: The inclusion criteria for participants were specific, as detailed in the "Participants" section on page 6. Children were included in the study if they were not repeating a grade. They also had to be free of any developmental, psychological, and/or psychiatric disorders. Finally, the children needed to have normal or corrected vision and hearing.
> 
> quote: "For analytical purposes, participants were included according to the following criteria: non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and with normal or corrected vision and hearing." (page 6/Participants)

• **Find the exclusion criteria.**

> short answer: Participants were excluded if they were non-repeating students, showed developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders, or had vision or hearing impairments.
> 
> long answer: The exclusion criteria for the study were: "non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and with normal or corrected vision and hearing."
> 
> quote: "For analytical purposes, participants were included according to the following criteria: non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and with normal or corrected vision and hearing." (page 6, section "Participants")

• **What was the training duration? Compute step by step. calculate as follow: e.g. 10-15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks -> =((10*5*2) + (15*5*2)) /2; take the mean between the minimum and maximum**

> short answer: The training lasted for 2 months with sessions of 10-15 minutes, once or twice a week.
> 
> long answer: Participants in the training groups completed individual sessions lasting between 10-15 minutes each. The training was conducted once or twice a week for a duration of 2 months.
> 
> quote: "During the experimental conditions (training and control), children performed on individual sessions of 10–15 min each one, once or twice a week for 2 months." (page 6/Participants)

• **What was the CONTROL duration? Compute step by step. calculate as follow: e.g. 10-15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks -> =((10*5*2) + (15*5*2)) /2; take the mean between the minimum and maximum**

> short answer: The control group (CG) completed 6 sessions over two months. The sessions' duration was 10-15 min.
> 
> long answer: Participants in the control group (CG) completed 6 sessions. Each session for all participants (including the CG) was of 10-15 min. The experimental conditions (training and control) lasted two months (see 'Results', p. 517).
> 
> quote: "During the experimental conditions (training and control), children performed on individual sessions of 10–15 min each one, once or twice a week for 2 months. On average, participants in the TG completed 12 sessions (M = 11.7, SD = 1.9), while those in the CG completed 6 sessions" (p. 517, 'Results').

• **describe the activity of the control group. BAU = business as usual = what participants would normally do during that time**

> short answer: The control group performed the first level of the training tasks, which included level 1 of perceptual inhibition, cognitive inhibition, and response inhibition training tasks. long answer: The control group performed the first level of the training tasks which included the first level of the perceptual inhibition training task, the first level of the cognitive inhibition training task, and the first level of the response inhibition training task. quote: "The participants in CG performed the first level of the training tasks (see Training activities) – i.e., level 1 of perceptual inhibition training task (congruent trials; presentation time of stimuli: 1500 ms); level 1 of cognitive inhibition training task (with 30% of trails with irrelevant probes); and level 1 of response inhibition training task (sequences of one and two go trials previous to the no-go trial). In these levels, inhibitory processes are not significantly involved." (page 15, Control activities)

• **Were the assessors blind?**

> short answer: The assessors were blind.
> 
> long answer: Only the first author was not blind to the children's condition, the rest of the research assistants were.
> 
> quote: "1. This work is based on the first author's doctoral dissertation. Only she was not blind to the children condition. The rest of the research assistants were blind." (page 25/Note)

• **Are there primary and secondary outcomes? If yes, what are they? Near transfer? Far transfer?**

> Here's a breakdown of the outcomes based on the document provided:
> 
> short answer: Yes, primary and secondary outcomes exist. Near and far transfer effects were analyzed.
> long answer: The study aimed to design, implement, and evaluate the training effects of perceptual, cognitive, and response inhibition processes (primary). Secondary outcomes included the impact of training on working memory, cognitive flexibility, and fluid intelligence. Analyses focused on near transfer effects (performance changes on the trained inhibitory processes) and far transfer effects (transfer to other cognitive domains like WM, CF, and fluid intelligence).
> quote: "Therefore, the goals of this work are: (a) to design, implement and evaluate the training of perceptual, cognitive and response inhibition processes ... (b) To analyze near transfer effects of each type of inhibitory training. (c) To analyze far transfer effects on WM, CF and fluid intelligence tasks." (page 5, Discussion)

• **What is the socioeconomic status of the participants? Is there interindividual variability?**

> short answer: The participants were predominantly from middle socioeconomic (SES) homes, according to the Hollingshead (2011) index. Yes, there is interindividual variability.
> 
> long answer: The participants' socioeconomic status was assessed and revealed that the children were "predominantly from middle socioeconomic (SES) homes" according to the Hollingshead (2011) index, which was used in different studies. While the paper states the general socioeconomic status, the use of this index likely indicates interindividual variability within the sample.
> 
> quote: "They were predominantly from middle socioeconomic (SES) homes according to Hollingshead (2011) index used in different studies with similar sample" (page 6, Participants)

• **Do participants have any diagnosis (e.g. ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, depression, etc...)? If ADHD, specify the subtype (inattentive, hyperactive, combined). Also specify if medicated or not.**

> short answer: No, participants excluded if they had any developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders.
> long answer: Participants were excluded from the study if they had any developmental, psychological, and/or psychiatric disorders. The paper did not specifically mention any diagnoses for the participants, including ADHD or any of its subtypes, nor whether they were medicated.
> quote: "For analytical purposes, participants were included according to the following criteria: non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and with normal or corrected vision and hearing." (page 6, Participants section)

• **For each task (focus on these dimensions: inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention. For other kind of tasks (e.g. intelligence with WAIS), make a 'others' section), specify the task name (e.g. Stroop, Flanker, N-back) and mean and sd of the main performance measure at pre AND post training. Do this for the training groups but ALSO for the control group.**

• **Comment on how the attribution to groups was implemented  (randomization type). Also was it random, pseudo-random (when matched for age/gender baseline, etc...) or cluster-random (e.g. by classroom)?**

> short answer: The children were randomly allocated to either the experimental or control group, without any matching.
> long answer: The study implemented random allocation of children to either the experimental or the control group. The paper does not mention any matching or cluster randomization.

There was no association between sex and group (control vs. experimental), x²(1) = 2.45, p = .117...". (page 3, section 2.1)

• **Find the inclusion criteria.**

> short answer: The inclusion criteria were: absence of behavioral problems, IQ ≥70, and school performance within the average range.
> long answer: The inclusion criteria in the study were designed to ensure the sample consisted of children who were generally functioning well academically and behaviorally. The inclusion criteria were: (1) absence of behavioral indicators of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and relationship problems with peers (indicated on a parent-rated scale); (2) children with general intelligence (intelligence quotient - IQ) ≥70; (3) school performance within the average range (z-scores >-1.5) in mathematics, reading, and spelling.

• **describe the activity of the control group. BAU = business as usual = what participants would normally do during that time**

> short answer: The control group participated in a quiz that featured the same animals and themes as those of the PRAMEMT.
> long answer: The control group participated in a quiz that featured the same animals and themes as those of the PRAMEMT. The task had five modules with 15 questions each. The questions were presented using the PowerPoint® software. If the child could not read, the examiner would read the questions out loud. After the child had answered five questions in a module, they received a reinforcement similar to that of the PRAMEMT rewards (stickers). The questions were about the habitat of the animals, what they eat, where they are usually found in Brazil, and their physical characteristics and common habits. The questions were answered in groups or pairs of children.

(page 3, section 3.1)

• **Were the assessors blind?**

> short answer: No, the assessors were not blind.
> long answer: The assessors were undergraduate and graduate psychology students who had been previously trained. They were involved in both the cognitive training and control group activities.
> quote: "The examiners were undergraduate and graduate psychology students who had been previously trained. The cognitive training and control group activities occurred in five weekly sessions" (page 3, section 2.2).

• **Are there primary and secondary outcomes? If yes, what are they? Near transfer? Far transfer?**

> short answer: Yes, the primary outcomes were IQ and school-related abilities. Near transfer occurred in tasks similar to the content of the training (visuospatial WM). Far transfer was observed in school-related abilities.
> 
> long answer: The primary outcomes were IQ (FSIQ, VIQ, PIQ) and school-related abilities (phonological awareness, reading, writing, mathematics) as per the Abstract and Section 2.4 "Instruments" on page 332 and page 335. Near transfer was likely in the visuospatial WM tasks, given that the PRAMEMT focused on them as noted in the discussion, specifically on page 340. Far transfer was considered to have occurred in school-related abilities.
> 
> quote: "This study aimed to investigate the effect of a WMT software program (Programa de Ativação da Memória de Trabalho [PRAMEMT]) in promoting gains on cognitive and school related abilities. " (page 332, Abstract). "The battery assesses eight neuropsychological functions: time and space orientation, attention, visual perception, memory, mathematical abilities, language, visuoperceptual abilities, and EFs. However, in this study, we used only the subscales of WM (verbal and visuospatial), language (phonological awareness, reading, and spelling) and mathematical abilities." (page 335, Section 2.4 "Instruments"). "In that sense, considering that the PRAMEMT focuses on visuospatial WM tasks, the mean gain of ~5 points in PIQ could be partially explained by this similarity." (page 340, Discussion) "Far transfer was considered to have occurred in school-related abilities" (page 340, Discussion)

• **What is the socioeconomic status of the participants? Is there interindividual variability?**

> short answer: The socioeconomic status of the participants was assessed, and the majority belonged to a lower socioeconomic status. There was interindividual variability.
> long answer: The study used the Brazil Socioeconomic Questionnaire. "Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, 53.3% of the sample belonged to the lower socioeconomic status" (page 3/section 2.1). The study used the Brazil Socioeconomic Questionnaire.

• **Do participants have any diagnosis (e.g. ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, depression, etc...)? If ADHD, specify the subtype (inattentive, hyperactive, combined). Also specify if medicated or not.**

> short answer: The paper mentions excluding participants with conduct, hyperactivity, and relationship problems. It does not specify any diagnoses or subtypes. The paper does not mention if the participants were medicated or not.
> long answer: The inclusion criteria for the study excluded children with "absence of behavioral indicators of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and relationship problems with peers (indicated on a parent-rated scale)" (page 3/section 2.1). The paper does not mention any specific diagnoses, subtypes, or if the participants were medicated.
> quote: "The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) absence of behavioral indicators of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and relationship problems with peers (indicated on a parent-rated scale)" (page 3/section 2.1)

• **For each task (focus on these dimensions: inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention. For other kind of tasks (e.g. intelligence with WAIS), make a 'others' section), specify the task name (e.g. Stroop, Flanker, N-back) and mean and sd of the main performance measure at pre AND post training. Do this for the training groups but ALSO for the control group.**
