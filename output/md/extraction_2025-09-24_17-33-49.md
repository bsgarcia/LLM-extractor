*Processed on: 2025-09-24 17:37:16*

**Q1:** Comment on how the attribution to groups was implemented  (randomization type). Also was it random, pseudo-random (when matched for age/gender baseline, etc...) or cluster-random (e.g. by classroom)?

> **Short Answer:**
> Participants were randomly assigned to the different training and control groups.

> **Long Answer:**
> Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: a response inhibition-training group (n = 30), a perceptual inhibition-training group (n = 25), a cognitive inhibition-training group (n = 24), or an active control group (n = 31). The study explicitly states random assignment without specifying pseudo-random or cluster methods.

> **Quote:**
> Participants were randomly assigned to the following conditions: (a) response inhibition-training group (TG; n = 30); (b) perceptual inhibition-TG (n = 25); (c) cognitive inhibition-TG (n = 24); (d) Control active group (GC; n = 31). (page 6, Ethical considerations and procedure)

**Q2:** Find the sample size WITHOUT the drop outs (i.e. the final N used in the analysis). Same thing but depending on groups. What was the number of participants (included in analysis) in the training groups? And in control groups (if any)?

> **Short Answer:**
> The final sample size included in the analysis for short-term transfer effects was 110 participants. The training groups had 79 participants in total, and the control group had 31.

> **Long Answer:**
> The final sample size used in the short-term transfer analysis was 110 participants. These participants were distributed across four groups:
> *   **Training Groups (total n = 79):**
>     *   Response inhibition-training group: n = 30
>     *   Perceptual inhibition-training group: n = 25
>     *   Cognitive inhibition-training group: n = 24
> *   **Control Group (n = 31):**
>     *   Control active group: n = 31
> These numbers align with the degrees of freedom reported in the short-term ANOVA analyses (e.g., F(1,106) for Time effects, implying a total N of 110 minus 4 groups equals 106 degrees of freedom for error). For long-term transfer effects (posttest2), the total sample size was reduced to 98 due to 12 participants not performing tasks at that stage.

> **Quote:**
> "An intentional sample of 110 children (62 girls and 48 boys, 6 to 8 years old, first to third graders) from two elementary schools of the city of Mar del Plata, was included." (page 6, "Participants" section)
> "Participants were randomly assigned to the following conditions: (a) response inhibition-training group (TG; n = 30); (b) perceptual inhibition-TG (n = 25); (c) cognitive inhibition-TG (n = 24); (d) Control active group (GC; n = 31). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the total sample and the groups" (page 6, "Ethical considerations and procedure" section)
> "Short-term transfer. With regard to TF, no effect of Time -F(1,106) = 1.955, p = .165, n²p= .018- or Experimental condition -F(1,106) = 0.850, p= .470, n²p = .023- were observed." (page 17, "Response inhibition" section)

**Q3:** Find the inclusion criteria.

> **Short Answer:**
> Participants were included if they were non-repeating students, had no developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders, and possessed normal or corrected vision and hearing.

> **Long Answer:**
> The inclusion criteria for the study's participants were explicitly defined to ensure a suitable sample for the research. Children were included if they were non-repeating students, indicating they were progressing normally through school. Furthermore, they had to be free of any developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders, which would otherwise confound the study's findings on inhibitory processes. Lastly, normal or corrected vision and hearing were required to ensure they could adequately participate in the experimental tasks.

> **Quote:**
> For analytical purposes, participants were included according to the following criteria: non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and with normal or corrected vision and hearing. (page 6, Participants)

**Q4:** Find the exclusion criteria.

> **Short Answer:**
> Participants were excluded if they were repeating students, had developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders, or had impaired vision or hearing. Additional exclusions were for not meeting inclusion criteria, participation in a pilot study, or failing to complete pretest/posttest 1 tasks.

> **Long Answer:**
> Participants were excluded from the study if they were repeating students, presented with developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders, or had abnormal or uncorrected vision and hearing. Furthermore, 33 cases were excluded for not meeting the general inclusion criteria, 31 children had participated in a prior pilot study, and 11 participants who did not complete one or more tasks in the pretest and posttest 1 instances were also excluded.

> **Quote:**
> For analytical purposes, participants were included according to the following criteria: non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and with normal or corrected vision and hearing. The information was collected through a sanitary card that children's parents/caregivers completed. We obtained 185 informed consents from children's parents/caregivers, but 33 cases were excluded because they did not meet with the inclusion criteria and 31 children participated in a prior pilot study to test the procedure. Finally, participants who left the study or who did not complete one or more tasks in the pretest and posttest 1 instances (11 cases) were excluded.

**Q5:** What was the training duration? Compute step by step. calculate as follow: e.g. 10-15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks -> =((10*5*2) + (15*5*2)) /2; take the mean between the minimum and maximum

> **Short Answer:**
> The training duration was approximately 146.25 minutes, based on individual sessions of 10–15 minutes and an average of 11.7 sessions completed by the training groups over two months.

> **Long Answer:**
> Individual training sessions were 10–15 minutes each, conducted once or twice a week over a two-month period. On average, participants in the training groups (TG) completed M = 11.7 sessions (SD = 1.9). To calculate the total training duration, the minimum and maximum session times are multiplied by the average number of sessions: Minimum total duration = 10 minutes/session * 11.7 sessions = 117 minutes. Maximum total duration = 15 minutes/session * 11.7 sessions = 175.5 minutes. The mean of this range is then calculated: (117 + 175.5) / 2 = 146.25 minutes.

> **Quote:**
> During the experimental conditions (training and control), children performed on individual sessions of 10–15 min each one, once or twice a week for 2 months. On average, participants in the TG completed 12 sessions (M = 11.7, SD = 1.9)

**Q6:** What was the CONTROL duration? Compute step by step. calculate as follow: e.g. 10-15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks -> =((10*5*2) + (15*5*2)) /2; take the mean between the minimum and maximum

> **Short Answer:**
> The control group (CG) participated in sessions averaging 12.5 minutes each, completing an average of 6 sessions, resulting in a total control duration of approximately 75 minutes.

> **Long Answer:**
> Individual sessions for both training and control conditions lasted between 10 to 15 minutes. The average duration for a single session is calculated as (10 + 15) / 2 = 12.5 minutes. On average, participants in the control group (CG) completed 6 sessions (M = 6.32, SD = 3.04). Therefore, the total control duration is computed as 12.5 minutes/session * 6 sessions = 75 minutes.

> **Quote:**
> During the experimental conditions (training and control), children performed on individual sessions of 10–15 min each one, once or twice a week for 2 months. On average, participants in the TG completed 12 sessions (M = 11.7, SD = 1.9), while those in the CG completed 6 sessions (M = 6.32, SD = 3.04).

**Q7:** describe the activity of the control group. BAU = business as usual = what participants would normally do during that time

> **Short Answer:**
> The control group (CG) engaged in the first, easiest level of the same training tasks as the experimental groups (perceptual, cognitive, and response inhibition tasks), but at a level where inhibitory processes were not significantly involved. They completed an average of M = 6.32 sessions.

> **Long Answer:**
> The control active group (CG, n = 31) participated in individual sessions of 10–15 minutes, once or twice a week for 2 months, completing an average of M = 6.32 sessions (SD = 3.04). Their activities involved performing the first, lowest difficulty level of the training tasks: 
> - **Perceptual inhibition training task**: Level 1 (congruent trials; presentation time of stimuli: 1500 ms).
> - **Cognitive inhibition training task**: Level 1 (with 30% of trials with irrelevant probes).
> - **Response inhibition training task**: Level 1 (sequences of one and two go trials previous to the no-go trial). 
> These activities were designed such that inhibitory processes were not significantly involved, serving as an active control condition.

> **Quote:**
> The participants in CG performed the first level of the training tasks (see Training activities) – i.e., level 1 of perceptual inhibition training task (congruent trials; presentation time of stimuli: 1500 ms); level 1 of cognitive inhibition training task (with 30% of trails with irrelevant probes); and level 1 of response inhibition training task (sequences of one and two go trials previous to the no-go trial). In these levels, inhibitory processes are not significantly involved. (page 15, Control activities)

**Q8:** Were the assessors blind?

> **Short Answer:**
> The first author was not blind to the children's condition, but the rest of the research assistants were blind during the study.

> **Long Answer:**
> In this work, which is based on the first author's doctoral dissertation, it is explicitly stated that only the first author was not blind to the children's condition. However, all other research assistants involved in the study were blind to this information, suggesting a partial blinding approach to minimize bias.

> **Quote:**
> This work is based on the first author's doctoral dissertation. Only she was not blind to the children condition. The rest of the research assistants were blind. (page 25, Note)

**Q9:** Are there primary and secondary outcomes? If yes, what are they? Near transfer? Far transfer?

> **Short Answer:**
> Yes, the study defined primary outcomes as the evaluation of inhibitory processes training, and secondary outcomes as near, far, short-term, and long-term transfer effects.

> **Long Answer:**
> The primary outcome of the study was to design, implement, and evaluate the training of perceptual, cognitive, and response inhibition processes. The secondary outcomes involved analyzing different types of transfer effects: near transfer (generalization of training effects to other tasks demanding the same Executive Function, i.e., each inhibitory process), and far transfer (effects transferred to other domains and abilities, specifically Working Memory, Cognitive Flexibility, and Fluid Intelligence tasks). These transfer effects were examined in both the short-term (immediately after training) and long-term (6 months after training end).

> **Quote:**
> In such a context, the aims of this work were: (a) to design, implement and evaluate training of perceptual, cognitive and response inhibition processes, in a sample of school-aged children (6 to 8 years old); and (b) to analyze near, far, short- and long-transfer effects. An experimental design with three training groups (one for each inhibitory process) and an active control group was implemented. Near transfer effects were not observed. We found effects on a visuospatial working memory task in the short term, after the training in the response and cognitive inhibition, and effects on a fluid intelligence task in both the short and long term after the training in cognitive inhibition. The results contribute to a conceptualization of multidimensional inhibitory processes and the plausibility of training them during childhood. (page 2, Abstract)

**Q10:** What is the socioeconomic status of the participants? Is there interindividual variability?

> **Short Answer:**
> Participants were predominantly from middle socioeconomic homes, and there was interindividual variability in SES, with means ranging from 34.768 to 39.315 and standard deviations from 12.002 to 14.541 across groups.

> **Long Answer:**
> The participants were predominantly from middle socioeconomic (SES) homes, categorized using the Hollingshead (2011) index. Interindividual variability in SES was observed within the sample, reflected by the standard deviations for each group: Response inhibition EG (M = 39.315, SD = 12.849), Perceptual inhibition EG (M = 35.636, SD = 14.541), Cognitive inhibition EG (M = 36.454, SD = 12.002), and CG (M = 34.768, SD = 12.876). A one-way ANOVA confirmed basal homogeneity between groups regarding SES (F = 0.612, p = .609), indicating no significant differences in SES among the groups at the study's outset.

> **Quote:**
> They were predominantly from middle socioeconomic (SES) homes according to Hollingshead (2011) index used in different studies with similar sample... (page 6, Participants). SES (Table 2): Response inhibition EG: M = 39.315, SD = 12.849; Perceptual inhibition EG: M = 35.636, SD = 14.541; Cognitive inhibition EG: M = 36.454, SD = 12.002; CG: M = 34.768, SD = 12.876. SES (Table 3, One-way ANOVA): F = 0.612, p = .609 (page 16, Table 3).

**Q11:** Do participants have any diagnosis (e.g. ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, depression, etc...)? If ADHD, specify the subtype (inattentive, hyperactive, combined). Also specify if medicated or not.

> **Short Answer:**
> No, participants in the study were excluded if they had developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders. Therefore, they did not have diagnoses such as ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, or depression.

> **Long Answer:**
> The study's inclusion criteria explicitly excluded participants with any developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders. This means that individuals with diagnoses like ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, or depression were not part of the sample. The paper does not provide information regarding specific subtypes of ADHD or medication status, as these conditions led to exclusion from the study.

> **Quote:**
> For analytical purposes, participants were included according to the following criteria: non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and with normal or corrected vision and hearing. (page 6, Participants section)

**Q12:** For each task (focus on these dimensions: inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention. For other kind of tasks (e.g. intelligence with WAIS), make a 'others' section), specify the task name (e.g. Stroop, Flanker, N-back) and mean and sd of the main performance measure at pre AND post training. Do this for the training groups but ALSO for the control group.

> **Short Answer:**
> The study assessed performance on inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and fluid intelligence tasks at pre-training, immediately post-training (posttest1), and 6 months post-training (posttest2) for three inhibitory training groups and a control group, with detailed means and standard deviations provided in Table 2.
