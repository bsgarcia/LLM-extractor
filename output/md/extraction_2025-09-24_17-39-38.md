## Aydmune et al. - 2019 - Inhibitory Processes Training for School-age Child

*Processed on: 2025-09-24 17:41:36*

**Q1:** Comment on how the attribution to groups was implemented  (randomization type). Also was it random, pseudo-random (when matched for age/gender baseline, etc...) or cluster-random (e.g. by classroom)?

> **Short Answer:**
> Participants were randomly assigned to the different training and control groups.

> **Long Answer:**
> Participants were randomly assigned to four conditions: response inhibition-training group (TG; n = 30), perceptual inhibition-TG (n = 25), cognitive inhibition-TG (n = 24), and an active control group (GC; n = 31). This indicates a random assignment type.

> **Quote:**
> Participants were randomly assigned to the following conditions: (a) response inhibition-training group (TG; n = 30); (b) perceptual inhibition-TG (n = 25); (c) cognitive inhibition-TG (n = 24); (d) Control active group (GC; n = 31). (page 6, Ethical considerations and procedure section)

**Q2:** Find the sample size WITHOUT the drop outs (i.e. the final N used in the analysis). Same thing but depending on groups. What was the number of participants (included in analysis) in the training groups? And in control groups (if any)?

> **Short Answer:**
> The final sample size included in the analysis, after excluding participants who did not complete pretest or posttest 1 tasks, was 110. The training groups had a total of 79 participants, and the control group had 31.

> **Long Answer:**
> The study initially included 110 children after excluding 11 cases who did not complete one or more tasks in the pretest and posttest 1 instances. For these stages, the final number of participants in the training groups were:
> *   Response Inhibition EG: n = 30
> *   Perceptual Inhibition EG: n = 25
> *   Cognitive Inhibition EG: n = 24
> This sums to 79 participants across all training groups. The Control Group (CG) had n = 31 participants. For analyses involving posttest2 (long-term transfer), an additional 12 participants dropped out:
> *   Response Inhibition TG: n = 2 (remaining 28)
> *   Perceptual Inhibition TG: n = 3 (remaining 22)
> *   Cognitive Inhibition TG: n = 6 (remaining 18)
> *   Control Group: n = 1 (remaining 30)
> Therefore, the total sample size for posttest2 analysis was 98.

> **Quote:**
> "Finally, participants who left the study who did not complete one or more tasks in the pretest and posttest 1 instances (11 cases) were excluded." (page 6, Participants section)
> "Participants were randomly assigned to the following conditions: (a) response inhibition-training group (TG; n = 30); (b) perceptual inhibition-TG (n = 25); (c) cognitive inhibition-TG (n = 24); (d) Control active group (GC; n = 31)." (page 6, Participants section)
> "Twelve participants did not perform tasks at posttest2 (response inhibition-TG, n =2; perceptual inhibition-TG, n = 3; cognitive inhibition-TG, n = 6; CG, n = 1)." (page 15, Data preparation and analysis section)

**Q3:** Find the inclusion criteria.

> **Short Answer:**
> Participants were included if they were non-repeating students, free of developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders, and had normal or corrected vision and hearing.

> **Long Answer:**
> The inclusion criteria for the study participants were explicitly defined to ensure a homogeneous sample. Participants had to be non-repeating students, free from any developmental, psychological, or psychiatric disorders, and possess normal or corrected vision and hearing. This information was collected through a sanitary card completed by children's parents/caregivers. Out of 185 informed consents, 33 cases were excluded for not meeting these criteria.

> **Quote:**
> For analytical purposes, participants were included according to the following criteria: non-repeating students; absence of developmental, psychological and/or psychiatric disorders; and with normal or corrected vision and hearing. The information was collected through a sanitary card that children's parents/caregivers completed. We obtained 185 informed consents from children's parents/caregivers, but 33 cases were excluded because they did not meet with the inclusion criteria and 31 children participated in a prior pilot study to test the procedure. Finally, participants who left the study who did not complete one or more tasks in the pretest and posttest 1 instances (11 cases) were excluded. (page 6, Participants section)

**Q4:** Find the exclusion criteria.

> **Short Answer:**
> Participants were excluded if they did not meet inclusion criteria (e.g., had disorders or repeated grades), participated in a prior pilot study, or failed to complete pretest and posttest 1 tasks.

> **Long Answer:**
> Participants were excluded from the study if they did not meet the specified inclusion criteria, which included being non-repeating students, having no developmental, psychological, and/or psychiatric disorders, and possessing normal or corrected vision and hearing. Additionally, 31 children who participated in a prior pilot study were excluded. Finally, 11 cases were excluded because participants either left the study or did not complete one or more tasks during the pretest and posttest 1 instances.
